Discovery (QGIS plugin)
=======================

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lutraconsulting/qgis-discovery-plugin/master/Discovery/discovery_logo_64.png" alt="Logo">

The Discovery plugin adds search capability to QGIS. Its key features are:

- Connects directly to PostgreSQL / PostGIS (no reliance on web services)
- Auto-completion of results
- Flexible expression-based support for scales
- Can use multiple fields to display result context
- Simple GUI-based configuration

Weâ€™d like to thank Tim Martin of Ordnance Survey for his original PostGIS Search plugin which gave us inspiration and formed the foundation of Discovery.
